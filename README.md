## Linq
Today Lamba, of Whitworth University, announced the release of their new product, Linq. Linq is a product where social-media influencers and content creators view comments and interact with their audience in one place. 

Linq aggregates comments from a variety of social media platforms, such as Instagram, YouTube, and Twitch. Comments data is cached, so content creators have multiple views to choose from. Comments are viewable on a per-platform, per-user, per-post, or aggregated (all-together) basis. 

Linq has data processing features that allow content creators to interact with their audience through a single platform. For example, content creators can set trigger phrases/words to search for in their comments. Content creators can then add automatic responses and interactions. This allows users to easily respond to commonly asked questions, or to moderate their chat/comments section efficiently.

## FAQ

### How can I view my comments with Linq?
